This code is an MQL5 indicator that provides support and resistance analysis, signal generation, and historical data analysis for trading strategies. It includes several input parameters that allow the user to enable or disable specific features.

## Indicator Input Parameters
- **UseBreakerBlocks**: Enable or disable the generation of breaker blocks.
- **UseSupportResistance**: Enable or disable the support and resistance analysis.
- **UseSignalGeneration**: Enable or disable the generation of trading signals.

## Custom Indicator Initialization Function
The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate a successful initialization.

## Custom Indicator Iteration Function
The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new bar. It iterates through the bars and performs the following actions based on the enabled features:
- If breaker blocks are enabled, it calls the `GenerateBreakerBlocks()` function to generate breaker blocks for the current bar.
- If support and resistance analysis is enabled, it calls the `AnalyzeSupportResistance()` function to analyze support and resistance levels for the current bar.
- If signal generation is enabled, it calls the `GenerateSignals()` function to generate trading signals for the current bar.
- If historical data analysis is enabled, it calls the `AnalyzeHistoricalData()` function to analyze historical data for the current bar.

## Functions
- **GenerateBreakerBlocks()**: This function is responsible for generating breaker blocks for a specific bar. However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the code, and it needs to be implemented separately.
- **AnalyzeSupportResistance()**: This function analyzes support and resistance levels for a specific bar. Similar to the previous function, the implementation is not included in the code.
- **GenerateSignals()**: This function generates trading signals based on the high, low, and close prices of a specific bar. Again, the code for generating signals is not provided.
